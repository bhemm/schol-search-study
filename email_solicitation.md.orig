#Transforming scholarly search with Mendeley: participants needed
  
Can scholarly searching be improved by utilizing information stored
in your Mendeley library?

Help answer this question by participating in a research study
conducted by the University of North Carolina in the US. We’re
looking for participants who are willing to let us record their
academic searches and share their Mendeley library with us.  You
will help us see whether academic search results can be
personalized to your interests based on your Mendeley library.  And
you will be paid $50 USD for helping us advance science!

To learn more about the study and sign up as a participant, please

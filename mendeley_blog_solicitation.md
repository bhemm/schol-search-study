# Transforming scholarly search with Mendeley: participants needed

Once upon a time, scholars mostly accessed the literature by
reading select journals. Today, though, we
[increasingly turn to searches](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/tenopir/11tenopir.html) in expansive, flat indexes like Google Scholar, and that’s a win. But these searches could be better!

For one thing, academic search engines make heavy use of citation
as ranking signal. This is effective, but citations can take years
to accumulate, and so rankings can be stale.  Academic search
engines also deliver the same results to everyone, which can
present a lot of irrelevant results for an individual user. For
instance, a Google Scholar search for
“[status updates](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=status+updates&btnG=Search&as_sdt=0,34&as_ylo=&as_vis=0)”
gets you articles about social media, wireless sensor networks, and
Belizean bird species. You probably just want one of these.

One potential answer to both these problems is personalizing
scholarly search results using Mendeley libraries. Looking at
someone’s Mendeley collection, you could take a pretty good guess
as to whether they’d prefer to see an article about the bird
species Forster’s Tern or one about gateway fault tolerance. As an
added bonus, Mendeley collections tend to be pretty up-to-date
compared to publication or citation histories.

Personalizing search has a long and checkered history. But using
reference libraries this way is, as far as we know, pretty novel.
It’s also exciting --- since the domain (scholarship) is relatively
narrow, we might see better performance than general-purpose
personalization.

Given this potential, we are planning a study to see if we can in
fact improve scholarly search rankings by looking at users’
personal Mendeley libraries. To do this, we need some participants.
Specifically, we’re looking for folks who will let us record their
academic searches (and only the academic searches) for a month, and
let us have a look at their Mendeley libraries via the Mendeley
API. In return, we’re offering $50 USD and the satisfaction of
helping science!

To participate, please send an email to
[mendeleystudy@email.unc.edu](mailto:mendeley-study@email.unc.edu). We
will follow up with instructions on how to proceed. To learn more about the study, visit the[study website](http://jasonpriem/github.com/schol-search-study/overview_and_signup.html).

Thank you and watch this spot for our results in the fall!
